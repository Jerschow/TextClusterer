Possibly helpful functions for grading: print_bios in parse.py can be useful for grading parsing and weighting of words. print_children in graph.py can be used to print the children of every vertex in the graph

names of clusters were done as follows:
-if cluster had many nodes: find the 2 words with the most occurences in the cluster
-if cluster had 1 node: find the 2 words that appear the least in the entire input file using the weights dict

collaborators: None from class. However, I did use Vivake Gupta's python porter stemming algorithm from: https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/. porterstemmer.py is all his code and his code does not appear anywhere else in this repository.
